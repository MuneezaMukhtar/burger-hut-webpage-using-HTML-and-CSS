## I created an online burger shop website using HTML and CSS, focusing on delivering a visually appealing and functional design. The website features a clean, user-friendly interface that showcases the burger menu with enticing images and detailed descriptions. HTML was used to structure the content effectively, while CSS was employed to enhance the site's aesthetic with styling, including layouts, colors, and typography. The result is a seamless online experience that allows users to easily browse the menu and explore various burger options, making the ordering process straightforward and engaging.
